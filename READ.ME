In this repo i will  try to learn the network programming from the Packt Hands on Network Programming with C. I have learnt the conept of other things like mutex,threads,process,fork all those from Extreme C book but the socket part was a bit advacned so i choose this book to go from a bit basic to make me undersatnd the cod ebetter. After this i will get back and do the calcualtor project where i will allow two user to use the calcualtor at same time.
